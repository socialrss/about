# about - Social RSS General Information

Social RSS is an extension for RSS feeds that adds support for social network related information.
It is aimed mainly at feeds used for podcast, but it can be generally used.  
Podcast aggregators (also known as clients) can use this information for better integration with social networks and to provide this more functionality related to social activites to their users (i.e. contacting participants, or funding a podcast).

This repository is used as entry point for the whole project and for project organization.
For an overview of the **work in progress and roadmap**, check this [github project](https://github.com/orgs/socialrss/projects/1).

The main repository of the project is the [Social RSS specification](https://github.com/socialrss/socialrss).

## Origins

The author and idealizer of Social RSS is also a heavy podcast listener, ocasional podcaster and author of the podcast client [podStation](https://github.com/podStation/podStation).

The idea of creating a specification for extending feeds used for syndicating podcast to support also social network data (contact, funding, user groups, etc...) came from the need to enable podcast clients to foster the social contact between listeners and producers.
