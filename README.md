## Origins

The author and idealizer of Social RSS is also a heavy podcast listener, ocasional podcaster and author of the podcast client [podStation](https://github.com/podStation/podStation).

The idea of creating a specification for extending feeds used for syndicating podcast to support also social network data (contact, funding, user groups, etc...) came from the need to enable podcast clients to foster the social contact between listeners and producers.
